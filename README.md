# Classifying-MaskOrder-of-Traces
**Goal**:
Determine if a Neural Network can learn from the masked traces and classify them according to their different orders of masking.

**Dataset**
Toy Dataset created under the file `gen_mask_traces`. We only want to classify masking order from 0 to 3. 

**TODO:**:
1. Create a Neural Network architecture
2. Plot tensorboard on the accuracy and loss. 


** Results **
To be updated.
